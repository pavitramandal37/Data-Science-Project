# Text Mining Project
Problem Statement: -
In the era of widespread internet use, it is necessary for businesses to understand what the consumers think of their products. If they can understand what the consumers like or dislike about their products, they can improve them and thereby increase their profits by keeping their customers happy. For this reason, they analyze the reviews of their products on websites such as Amazon or Snapdeal by using text mining and sentiment analysis techniques.
